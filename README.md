*Yet Another Note Taking App*

This project is not a real world application, and does not provide the features you would expect from a note taking app (such as data synchronization). It was just a pretext for me to learn Vue.js.

The project is deployed [here](https://yanta.nils.cx), if you want to see what it looks like.

**Start the project**

Install the dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

Generate the initial notes

```bash
DIR=./sample-notes node ./sample-notes/generate-data > ./src/data.json
```

Start the project using vue-cli-service

```bash
yarn start
```
